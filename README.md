## Android Lollipop *Material Design*
#### Notes for New England Java User Group *Lightning Talk*
#####January 8, 2015


New release of Android is “Lollipop,” shipped in November 2014. Many exciting new features, including a new Android RunTime and improved battery life.
But the new design philosophy called "Material Design” is arguably Android Lollipop’s most far-reaching new feature.

Will do a shallow overview of the design principles embodied in Material Design.

Then take a closer look at one aspect — activity transition animation where there are common shared view elements between the beginning (“calling”) and ending (“called”) activity screen. I’m not familiar with iOS, but this might be nothing new to iPhone/iOS developers?  :)

Will do a quick demo of the transition animation, then look at small code snippets.

The API feels a bit ‘rough round the edges’, documentation is not great and I’ve come across some parts that seem misleading to me. But we will be using default settings mostly, and are just touching the surface, so you’ll be shielded from any ugliness here in this talk.
